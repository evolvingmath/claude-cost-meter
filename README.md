# Claude Cost Meter

A live, at-a-glance meter for what your **Claude Code** session is costing — in API-equivalent dollars — without leaving your workflow. Two surfaces of the same idea:

- **CLI statusline** — a line at the bottom of the Claude Code terminal (any OS).
- **macOS menu bar** — a [SwiftBar](https://swiftbar.app) plugin showing the **total cost of today's sessions** in the menu bar (visible over any app), with a per-session breakdown on click. Works whether you drive Claude from the **Claude Code CLI** or the **Claude desktop app** (both write their transcripts to the same place).

> **"API-equivalent"** = tokens × published Anthropic API prices, with correct prompt-cache tiers. On an API key it's your real spend; on a Pro/Max subscription it's the counterfactual ("what this *would* have cost") — a useful gauge of how hard you're leaning on the model.

## What it looks like

```
Opus · ≈$0.42 · ctx 18% · 5h 23% · 7d 41%        ← CLI statusline

≈$278.67                                          ← menu bar = today's total (click ↓)
  7 sessions today · ≈$278.67
  ● "Add a dark-mode toggle to the dashboard"  ≈$28.61   ← hover a row for details ↓
       Model: opus-4-8 · Main ≈$26.37 · Subagents ≈$2.24
       Tokens in 19.2K · out 201K · cache rd 12.2M · wr 1.4M
       Reveal transcript in Finder
  ○ "Refactor the CSV export module"  ≈$83.69
  …                                                  (● live · ○ idle)
```

## Who can run it

- **CLI statusline (`cost-meter.py`)** — anyone using the **Claude Code CLI**, on macOS, Linux, or Windows. Python 3 standard library only; it just formats the JSON Claude Code already hands a statusline on stdin.
- **macOS menu bar (`claudecost.5s.py`)** — anyone on a **Mac** whose Claude sessions land under `~/.claude/projects/` (the Claude Code CLI *and* the Claude desktop app both do). Needs [SwiftBar](https://swiftbar.app) (free) + Python 3.

No accounts, no network calls, no secrets — both read only your local transcript files.

## Install

### CLI statusline (any OS)

1. Copy `cost-meter.py` to `~/.claude/cost-meter.py`.
2. Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "statusLine": { "type": "command", "command": "python3 ~/.claude/cost-meter.py" }
   }
   ```

Claude Code pipes a JSON blob to the script on stdin (cost, context %, model, and — on Pro/Max — rolling-window quota). It renders after each turn in <60 ms.

### macOS menu bar

```bash
brew install --cask swiftbar      # if you don't already have it
./install-macos-menubar.sh        # copies the plugin into SwiftBar's plugin folder
open -a SwiftBar
```

The meter appears in your menu bar within a few seconds, showing the day's total across all your sessions.

## How it works

- The **statusline** version is *handed* the numbers on stdin by Claude Code — it just formats them. Fast, no parsing.
- The **menu-bar** version has no stdin, so it scans `~/.claude/projects/` for every session active **today**, sums each turn's `usage` block (deduped by `requestId`) for the main loop **and** its subagents, and prices it with the table below. The menu bar shows the day's total; the dropdown lists each session (● live / ○ idle) with a hover submenu of details. It caches per file by mtime, so it only re-parses a session when it actually grows.

## Pricing table (keep this current)

Per million tokens. Cache read = 0.1× input · 5-min cache write = 1.25× · 1-hour cache write = 2×.

| Model      | Input | Output |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ |
| Fable 5    | $10   | $50    |
| Opus 4.x   | $5    | $25    |
| Sonnet 4.x | $3    | $15    |
| Haiku 4.5  | $1    | $5     |

Edit `PRICES` in either script when Anthropic changes prices or ships new models.

## Caveats

- **API-equivalent**, not your literal bill on a subscription (see top).
- Depends on the current Claude Code transcript shape (`~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` with per-turn `usage` + `requestId`). If that format changes, the menu-bar parser needs a tweak.
- Updates **per turn** (each completed reply), not token-by-token — only the process making the API call sees the live stream.
- The menu-bar version can't show the Pro/Max quota gauge (`5h`/`7d`) — that's only in the CLI's stdin payload, not in the transcript on disk.

## Customize

- **Colors:** `GOLD` / `DIM` near the top of each script.
- **Refresh rate:** rename the SwiftBar plugin file — `claudecost.5s.py` → `claudecost.10s.py` for a 10-second poll, etc.
